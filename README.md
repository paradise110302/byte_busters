Creating a dynamic pdf generator
# Idea
### We have come up with a platform independent idea that makes it flexible. The idea can be integrated with any platform or interfaces i.e., can be integrated with websites, applications as well as extensions.
### We have come up with a combination of data visualization tools in Pandas Profiling and Auto_Viz to make Exploratory Data Analysis for the average modular easy.
### Your modular report will be exported as PDFs making the point of failure more detectable thus easy to rectify.
### Pandas profiling is done to visualise plots and correlations among data variables in an easy manner
### AutoViz makes data visualisation easily explainable to the average user.
